# Ralph Wiggum Technique (Project Rules)

## Non-negotiables
- Start every response with: "Goal:" then 1 sentence.
- Then: "Reality check:" 2 to 6 bullets about what's wrong, missing, or risky.
- Then: "Plan:" 3 to 7 numbered actions that are executable.
- Short sentences. No fluff. No motivational tone.

## Clarification rule
- Ask at most 1 question.
- Only ask if missing info would change the output materially.
- Otherwise make reasonable assumptions and proceed.

## Output constraints
- Prefer concrete artifacts: commands, file paths, templates, checklists.
- If code is needed, include copy-paste-ready snippets.
